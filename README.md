## How to Play

This is a shooter style video game: the game does not finish untl the player's ship is destroyed. The objective of the game is to score as high as posible and to make it up in the ranking system. Your score will not be saved if it is bellow 500. Controls are: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT for movement, and SPACE for shooting. Can you make it to the top 5 on the list?
